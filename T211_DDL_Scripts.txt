 Request for Review of Marks due to Discrepancy in Grades



I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the recent grades I received for the course [Course Name]. Upon reviewing the grades, I noticed a discrepancy that I believe warrants further examination.

I received a CC grade for the course, while my friend, who scored lower marks than me in the first two in-sems, received a BC grade. Additionally, my performance in the mid-semester exams was consistently average, and I felt confident about my performance in the end-semester exam.

This grade is crucial for my CGPI, and I am deeply concerned about its impact. I am currently away from campus due to the vacation period, which adds to the urgency of resolving this matter as soon as possible.

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my end-semester marks to ensure that there has not been an oversight. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.


Sincerely,
